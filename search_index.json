The University of California recognizes that UAS offer great potential as tools for research and other educational functions as well as providing opportunities for recreational use and business pursuits across a diverse array of users and industries. The University also has an obligation to consider public safety, privacy, civil rights and civil liberties issues related to the use of UAS. In short, all UAS usage on UC property, for UC business or by UC-owned UAS must be pre-approved and documented by the designated UAS campus point of contact. In addition, non-UC operators on UC property must maintain sufficient liability insurance coverage. Who do I contact to fly on my campus? A list of the campus points of contact can be found here. Please understand that in many cases, the use of UAS on UC property are regulated by existing campus policies on activities, registered organizations and use of properties. These regulations are designed to protect and promote the rights of the members of the University, prevent interference with University functions or activities and assure compliance with all pertinent laws and other applicable University policies. For UC students, staff and faculty, you may submit a Flight Request with UC Drones Web App or contact the campus for additional or alternative means to submit a request. I need to fly a drone for my research. What do I need to do? How long does it take for approval? There may be several special circumstances, but in general, the operator must have an sUAS license from the FAA and must submit a Flight Request to the local campus point of contact. Depending on the complexity and timing of the request, the flight request could be approved in minutes or may take several weeks if extra FAA approval or coordination is necessary. A Flight Request may be a single flight, a set of flights or cover a year’s worth of activity – the details can be coordinated during the request. What are the laws for flying a drone in the US? The most common applicable set of laws for flying a drone is Part 107 (Flying for Work or Business https://www.faa.gov/uas/commercial_operators/). This set of law requires the operator to have an SUAS license, have a registered drone and follow the drone laws that limit drone flying to up to 400 ft AGL, during daylight only and may not fly over people or moving vehicles. There are additionally special circumstances or restrictions for foreign nationals (international students, visiting scholars), operating on certain public lands, or within certain states or municipalities. Can I fly a personal drone for my research project or my department? Yes, as long as you comply with UC policy. Anyone operating under UC policy for university business (regardless of ownership) may additionally be provided with UC UAS liability insurance coverage free of charge. I have a complicated or non-standard scenario. Who should I contact to identify what I need to do? Please feel free to contact either your campus point of contact or the UC Center of Excellence on UAS Safety. We will work to ensure that there is a path forward for you to conduct your flight activity. We have experience with international UAS regulations, public agency airworthiness certification, night-time operations, airspace authorizations, DOT foreign national operator permits and agricultural spraying certificates to name a few. I’m looking to fly a drone, but it says we are within 5 miles from the Davis Airport (KEDU). Is there anything we need to do to get approval to fly? The Davis Airport (KEDU) is an airport in Class G airspace, and no Airspace Authorization is required. Additionally, the requirement to notify all airports within 5 miles has been rescinded. You may fly a drone wherever you have permission to do so, without being required to notify KEDU.

This policy has a total of $5 Mil limit including Personal Injury. Coverage is automatic for UAS activity that meet the following criteria: Flight operations are conducted on behalf and sanctioned by the University of California. Aircraft weight under 55 lbs (at time of takeoff) Flight operations are within Visual Line of Sight Flight operations are below 400 ft above ground level. Flight operations must be conducted within the United States. Any UAS activity that do not meet the above criteria or operate outside the above criteria must be reported to and approved by the insurance underwriter in order to be covered. Personally Owned Unmanned Aircraft Used for University Business The University of California has extended their UAS liability policy to enable coverage of UAS owned by UC students, staff or faculty used for University Business, including research. Coverage is contingent on compliance with the policy and procedures on UAS usage. This coverage is not intended to cover student organizations or 3rd Party vendors or contractors. Coverage for Campus Police The University of California has extended their UAS liability policy to enable coverage of UAS by Campus Police. All coverage is contingent on the UAS activity being sanctioned by the UC. Any UAS activity that is not approved by a Designated Local Authority or Systemwide Designated UAS Authority is not covered by this liability insurance. Physical Damage Coverage Physical damage to Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) registered with the UC Center of Excellence on UAS Safety is provided by a physical damage policy from the University’s captive insurance company, Fiat Lux Risk and Insurance Company. Coverage applies in flight only when an approved flight plan is filed in accordance with UC UAS Policy, which includes the UC Drone web app or other means of compliance. Coverage applies to Unmanned Aircraft Systems not in flight, but only if the Unmanned Aircraft Systems are registered with the UC Center of Excellence on UAS Safety at the time of the loss. The policy limit per occurrence is $25,000 for UAS. Policy conditions and the scheduled value of the Unmanned Aircraft System may limit recovery. Unmanned Aircraft Systems are covered at present value not replacement cost. Depreciation does apply to claims for Unmanned Aircraft Systems. Unmanned Aircraft Systems with values greater than $25,000 can be endorsed to the policy. The UAS Physical Damage policy does not cover damage to payload or cargo; submit payload/cargo losses to the UC’s property policy. A $1,000 deductible applies per loss. If an Unmanned Aircraft System loss results in damage to payload/cargo, the deductible is pro-rated between the policies. In the event of a loss, please report to campus risk management. This physical damage coverage does not extend to personally owned Unmanned Aircraft Systems used for University Business. Only Unmanned Aircraft Systems owned by the University of California are covered. Filing a Claim To file a claim, contact your campus Risk Manager. Please prepare the following: Copy of the post-flight report (through UC Drones or other means of compliance) Photographs of damaged equipment Copy of original purchase invoice Copy of invoice to ship the equipment back the manufacturer Copy of repair invoice, if repairable Copy of replacement quote, if not repairable Ensure your coverage Attach a copy of your UAS invoice to your UAS registration in UC Drones Make sure you file your Flight Requests For recurrent or on-going activity, create a Project application but don’t forget to add flights before you head out. After an incident, make sure you take pictures of the damage and file a post-flight report. Add as much detail as possible. 3rd Party Insurance Minimum All 3rd Party UAS activity, including on behalf of the University or other users of campus space, must have liability insurance with a preferred limit of $5 Mil. In addition to the limit that is provided by the Operator, a certificate of insurance along with a copy of the endorsement listing the following insurance clauses should be issued prior to commencement of services: Name The University and its directors, officers, employees, servants and agents (collectively, the “Indemnified Parties” and individually, the “Indemnified Party”) as additional insureds, as their respective interests may appear The Operator’s insurance shall be primary without any right of contribution from any other insurance available to The University Include a cross liability or severability of interests among Indemnified Parties, providing that the insurance shall operate in all respects as if a separate policy had been issued covering each party insured Include a waiver of subrogation in favor of the Indemnified Parties. The certificate of insurance shall also provide that, in the event of a cancellation or material restrictive change of the policy which would adversely affect the interest of the Indemnified Parties, the insurers agree to provide 30 days prior written notice to The University. "],["ch-cybersecurity.html", "Cybersecurity Concerns Cybersecurity Risk Mitigation Strategies", " Cybersecurity Concerns The use of an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) designed, manufactured, or supplied by foreign companies could create increased cybersecurity risks and opportunities for network exploitation and collection by foreign threat actors. Cybersecurity Risk Potential security risks can arise when UAS manufacturers require users to register online and agree to store sensitive data on overseas or even domestic computer servers. These servers are typically maintained by the manufacturers, but can be accessed by third-party application vendors. In addition, online services offered by UAS manufacturers could create opportunities for the theft or seizure of sensitive information and the monitoring of user activities. Foreign threat actors could exploit: Flight log data, including information about network layouts and the locations of inspections and critical assets; Organizations’ computer network data and systems; Images or recordings captured during flights, including physical security assets, vulnerabilities, and transportation networks; Corporate proprietary information or intellectual property; LE-sensitive information; Sensor data collected during critical infrastructure inspections; Emergency response operations and mission-planning information; Sensitive facility locations and assets; and Customers’ personally identifiable information (PII). Mitigation Strategies Here are a couple of suggestions to reduce the potential data risks and vulnerabilities associated with UAS use and mitigate the loss of sensitive information. During initial UAS activation, use a department or lab name, email address, and password to reduce a UAS manufacturer’s ability to track the owner/user through association with this identifier. Note: It should be assumed that the current GPS location will be transmitted during UAS activation, which could reveal the true owner. Do not connect personal social media accounts with devices used for University business. Disable any sharing of imagery or video with social media accounts. Use a new mobile device without a SIM card installed or set up previously and never used for other activities for that will contain limited to no PII collectable by a foreign UAS company. For previously used devices, performing a wipe and factory reset of the mobile device prior to using it as a controller is advisable. Periodically wipe or clear sensitive data from the system, including information stored on onboard or removable digital storage devices—such as SD and memory cards—and on connected flight controllers and mobile devices. Sensitive data should also be cleared before returning borrowed or rented UASs. Avoid connecting the UAS to internal or private networks with sensitive data. Use a known secured network to register the UAS, and use a local backup device to store footage and data. Before applying UAS patches and upgrades, consider their impact on operations. Review user agreements to verify who has access to data collected by the UAS. Inquire or review user agreements for information about third-party access to UAS data. Maintain awareness of third-party collection and retention of data collected during UAS operations and develop appropriate policies to ensure the protection of intellectual property and sensitive operations. "],["dji-drones.html", "DJI Drones Frequently Asked Questions Timeline of Events", " DJI Drones DJI drones have been in the news recently, sometimes with alarmist headlines such as ‘DJI BLACKLISTED.’ On this page, we will clear up some misconceptions. DJI (Dà-Jiāng Innovations Science and Technology Co., Ltd) is a Chinese technology company that manufactures drones and camera stabilization systems. Concerns regarding DJI drones typically stem from the following items: Cybersecurity concerns with DJI - unsecured data links between GCS and drone Cybersecurity concerns with DJI - Apps collect unauthorized information from devices Cybersecurity concerns with data transfer to DJI servers, which may include images, video, and telemetry data. China’s National Intelligence Law requires Chinese companies to cooperate with the government. DJI’s role in the Chinese government’s Military-Civil Fusion strategy DJI’s alleged involvement in the surveillance of ethnic minority Uighurs in China’s far-western region of Xinjiang. These concerns have varying levels of validity and impact, and the news headlines can often be misleading. Frequently Asked Questions Are DJI Drones’ blacklisted’? As of today, DJI Drones have the following restrictions: The Department of Defense prohibits its funds from being used to purchase or use any commercial off-the-shelf drones, regardless of manufacturer, due to cybersecurity concerns. Announcement The Department of Defense prohibits the use of all commercial off-the-shelf drones from being used on military facilities and property. Announcement The Department of the Interior prohibits any funds (including from grants/contracts) from purchasing foreign-made drones without authorization. However, the existing fleet of DJI drones used by the Department of the Interior is still allowed. Announcement The Department of Justice prohibits the purchase or use of any drone that is manufactured or assembled by a covered foreign entity, which includes DJI (Announcement). As of January 2023, Florida prohibits all state agencies from purchasing or using any drone, not from an approved manufacturer. The list of Florida Approved Manufacturers can be found here. DJI is not an approved manufacturer. Despite the headlines, actual DJI drone restrictions are uncommon. However, if you do not want to use a drone from DJI for any reason, feel free to purchase an alternative. If you have documentation of another agency or entity that prohibits or restricts DJI drones, please let me know so I can update this list. I heard a law called “PROHIBITION ON OPERATION OR PROCUREMENT OF FOREIGN-MADE UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS” applies to all federal funds. Is this true?“ No. There is a law by that name; however, it does not apply to all federal funds. This law can be found in Section 848 of the NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2020. However, the section’s title is misleading - this law only applies to the Department of Defense. From the actual text of the law - “The Secretary of Defense may not operate or enter into or renew a contract for the procurement of – (a) a covered unmanned aircraft system…” I heard from my grant point of contact that DJI drones are prohibited. Are they wrong? Without further information, it is unclear. That person may be mistaken or are aware of a more direct policy that affects their particular division or group. If you are instructed by your research grant point of contact not to use DJI drones or that DJI drones are prohibited from being purchased, please abide by those instructions. Did the government ban people from buying DJI drones? No. While individual agencies and departments implement some restrictions, there are no nationwide bans from purchasing or using DJI drones. In addition, the government did not ban the import of DJI drones for sale. Has the UC system banned DJI drones? No. There are currently no UC systemwide restrictions on purchasing or using DJI drones. Additionally, as of today, no UC campus has restrictions on purchasing or using DJI drones. Are there cybersecurity concerns with DJI drones? Yes. All smart technology should be considered to have cybersecurity concerns, including drones. The primary concern of DJI drones is whether they can send data back to the Chinese government. DJI drones can upload data, including images, videos, and telemetry data, back to DJI data servers (the cloud) for storage. There is concern that this data may be accessible by the Chinese government and that the data may also include security concerns such as wifi network configurations that may be used for breaching networks. There have been numerous reports that both support and refute these concerns. There are several effective ways to mitigate these cybersecurity concerns with proper cybersecurity practices. Do not use your own personal devices (phones, tablets) or personal accounts (social media) when working with University equipment. Instead, register the drones to lab or department email accounts. Purchase platforms that do not require an additional phone or tablet. The higher-quality DJI projects, including the Enterprise editions and the Matrice series, offer all-in-one controllers that provide all of the necessary capabilities while not requiring an additional device. If a phone or tablet is required for operation, purchase a separate device without a SIM card. Do not authorize DJI to connect to any of your personal social media accounts Disable participation in DJI’s image and video social sharing service SkyPixel Only connect the drone to wireless networks appropriate for the general public, with security measures in place. For further information, we have posted guidance on addressing cybersecurity concerns. If I don’t want to get a DJI drone, what should I get? If you would like to explore non-DJI drones, we have put together a list of drones on this page and have included information on the manufacturer, where the drone is manufactured, whether it is Remote ID compliant, whether it is NDAA 848 compliant and whether it is on the BlueSUAS list. Is DJI funded by the Chinese government? According to DJI spokesman Adam Lisbern, “DJI is privately held. The company is solely managed by and majority-owned by the founder team. Shareholders other than founders do not participate in the company’s management and operation.” Washington Post. DJI maintains that it had not received direct investments from the Chinese government. However, it has been reported that divisions of China’s State Council directly administer some funds that list DJI as an investment. Can I collaborate with DJI on Drone research? Most likely, no. As with all collaborations with foreign entities, please consult your export control office for an authorized review. In Dec 2020, DJI was placed on an economic sanction list that restricts the export of US patents and intellectual properties to DJI, citing involvement in wide-scale human rights abuses within China through high-technology surveillance and/or facilitated the export of items by China that aid repressive regimes around the world, contrary to US foreign policy interests. What is NDAA 848 Compliance? While Section 848 of the NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2020 applies only to the Department of Defense, other agencies have begun to use this as a basis for determining ‘safe’ drones. NDAA 848 compliance specifically means that The drone is not manufactured in China or manufactured by a Chinese company; and The drone does not contain any major components made in China or by a Chinese company. Major components are defined as: Flight controllers Radios Data transmission devices Cameras Gimbals The drone does not use a ground control system or operating software developed in China or by a Chinese company; and The drone does not use network connectivity or data storage located in China or administered by a Chinese company.

Cheap Drones Drones for Multimedia Drones for Mapping The Best Drones High Security Drones Full Table of Drones", " Need to Pick a Drone? If you’re not sure what drone to get and you don’t want to spend a huge amount of money on a drone, here are some potential options. Check the New Users Guide for more suggestions: In addition to purchasing drones directly from the manufacturer, we recommend checking B&amp;H Photo since it’s widely available as a preferred vendor within the UC System with a substantial price discount. Cheap Drones Looking to get started with drones and don’t want to spend a lot of money? Try these lower cost, easy to use options: Mini 3 - The DJI Mini series are great, affordable and high-quality small drones. At only 249g, they pack a lot a capability into a tiny platform. It’s great as a flight trainer and good enough for some media use. The current models are the Mini 3, and Mini 3 Pro. Evo Nano+ - The Autel Nano+ is an alternative to the DJI Mini series. Similar to the DJI Mini series, it weighs only 249g, exempting it from registration when being used for recreation or educational activities. Drones for Multimedia If you are looking for a drone to take great pictures and videos, you don’t need to worry about software compatibility and instead can just focus on what has the best camera and which one is the easiest to fly. Mavic 3 - The DJI Mavic 3 is a great drone. It boasts a 45 minute flight time, a great camera, zoom up to 28x and almost all the features you could want from a drone - except its not compatible with mapping software. If you’re just doing cinematography, its a good, albeit pricey option at $2,000 ($2,800 with the extra battery combo pack). Mini 3 - The DJI Mini series are great, affordable and high-quality small drones. At only 249g, they pack a lot a capability into a tiny platform. It’s great as a flight trainer and good enough for some media use. The current models are the Mini 3, and Mini 3 Pro. Drones for Mapping If you want to use a drone for making high resolution maps and elevation models, you need a drone that is compatible with automated mapping software. These days, this functionality is exclusive to the more expensive drones. Mavic 3 Enterprise - The recently released Mavic 3 Enterprise is the only one of the Mavic 3 series that is capable of conducting autonomous flight operations necessary for mapping. While it has all of the great flight characteristics as the Mavic 3, the $4,000 price tag is a bit disappointing compared to DJI’s prior offerings. Skydio 2+ - The Skydio is the only non-DJI drone compatible with DroneDeploy. Starting at $999 for just the drone, it’s smaller than a Mavic, and the camera is not as high quality, but as DJI moves away from low-cost mapping functionality, it’s worth checking out for basic/simple flight missions. Autel Robotics EVO II - Autel has been in the drone business almost as long as DJI, but only its recent models have begun to get mainstream attention. At only $2,500, the newer Evo II Pro is a worthy Mavic competitor and unlike the DJI drones, has mapping software functionality built-in. The Best Drones If money is no issue, and you want the gold-standard in data collection for your research projects, focus first on the sensor package you want to carry. – RedEdge-P - The RedEdge-P is one of the most commonly used multispectral imagers available. High Resolution RGB and multispectral imagery with bands at Blue, Greed, Red, Red-Edge, Near-IR and panchromatic. $8k. – Altum-PT - If you need or want thermal imagery, take a look at the Altum-PT. It’s a complete solution with sychronized thermal, multispectral and RGB imagery in one package - $16k. Next, what platform should you pick to carry it. – DJI Matrice 300/350 - The DJI Matrice 300 and 350 are the new industry standards for the mid-lift drone category. It’s robust and capable enough to carry two cameras at once with a respectable flight time. There’s no other platform with a more robust ecosystem. The 350 is an updated version with an enhanced controller and battery system, but not a significant upgrade in flight performance. Packages range from $12k to $18k depending on configuration. – Freefly Alta X - The Alta X is a heavy-lift drone that’s configurable for just about any payload. With a lifting capacity of 30 lbs, there’s few things this drone can’t carry. Prices range from $18k to $36k depending on configuration and whether you need the NDAA 848 compliant or BlueSUAS version. High Security Drones However, not all drones may be suitable for your needs. Specific federal agencies may require drones that are compliant with NDAA 848 or on the BlueSUAS list. Unfortunately, there aren’t a lot of good options. WingtraOne Gen II - The Wingtra is a unique tail-sitter VTOL, capable of up to an hour of flight time and can cover some serious ground despite its small size. Consider this drone if you need something that can take off in a tight space, but still need to cover a lot of ground. NDAA848 compliant and BlueSUAS versions available. eBee X - The eBee series are small foam delta-wing drones that has been around for some time. In addition to being NDAA 848 compliant, they are also Class 3 compliant for operations over people. If you’re operating in big areas with plenty of room, these are a good option. Unfortunately, the eBee basic packages start at $13,500 without a payload, which may run an additional $4,000 to $10,000 depending on your needs. Skydio 2+ - The consumer grade Skydio 2+ is not on the BlueSUAS list nor has it been declared NDAA 848 compliant. But it is marketed as ‘US Made’ and that might be sufficient enough for some agency partners. We recommend the $2,000 cinematic package (with controller, hardcase and extra batteries) as the lowest cost RGB-only mapping drone.

Standard Remote ID Drones Broadcast Remote ID Modules Reading Remote Identification Frequently Asked Questions", " Remote Identification Remote Identification functionality will be required by March 16, 2024. Latest news - FAA Extends Remote ID Enforcement Date Six Months What is Remote Identification? Remote identification technology broadcasts information about a drone’s flight, location, and operator. This information can be picked up and viewed by anyone with the proper receiver, and is therefore public knowledge. It exists to notify nearby bystanders of a drone’s presence, and to aid law enforcement with monitoring and tracking down UAS in national airspace. For more information about Remote Identification, please visit the FAA’s website here Standard Remote Identification Most drones manufactured after December 2022 have RID already built-in to the drone’s firmware. Standard RID displays the drone’s location, altitude and speed, as well as the location and altitude of it’s operation station. Broadcast Remote Identification For drones that don’t have RemoteID built in, pilots must install a Remote ID broadcast module. This is a a small and lightweight component that can be added externally to a drone. It functions the same as standard remote identification, minus the ability to broadcast the location of the drone’s operator. Modules can only display the location of the drone’s takeoff point. FAA Recognized Identification Area (FRIA) For drones that do not have RID capabilities, the FAA is allowing pilots to fly their drones only in FRIAs. Visit the FAA’s UAS Data Delivery Service (UDDS) website to find a map of all FRIAs in the United States. Educational institutions and FAA-recognized Community Based Organizations can apply for a FRIA. Standard Remote ID Drones If your drone is equipped with remote ID or has the capabilities for it, then you are operating with standard remote ID. Often times, updating your drone’s firmware will likely activate remote ID if it was manufactured after December 2022. Otherwise, there are no further steps to take. Simply switch on your drone and enter flight mode, and remote ID will automatically trigger and broadcast information up until the drone is turned off. Some common drones with Standard Remote ID include: DJI Mavic 3 Series DJI Matrice 300/350 RTK DJI Mavic 2 Series* DJI Mini 3 Series Autel Evo II Pro v3 AgEagle eBee Skydio 2+ A full list of Standard Remote ID drones can be found in our Full Table of Drones Broadcast Remote ID Modules Remote ID modules were created to act as a substitution for standard remote ID, specifically for older drones that are unable to comply with the new regulation. There are a few on the market, with the most popular being the Dronetag Beacon and the DroneBeacon db120. When looking for the best module to purchase, make sure to look at battery life, size of the device, and the signal’s range. Available Broadcast Remote ID Modules Blue Mark DroneBeacon db120 (Figure 1) is ideal for all applications, as it has the ability to broadcast signals through Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or both. It is small and lightweight (25g), with a long battery life and even longer signal range. Available here for \\(\\text{€}129\\) Figure 1: Blue Mark db120 DroneTag Beacon (Figure 2) is an even lighter option at 15g, better for small drones such as the DJI Mavic series, albeit at a slightly higher cost.

In the new window, when it asks ‘Does your drone broadcast FAA Remote ID information?’ select ‘YES.’ Figure 4: Edit your UAS Registration Update your UAS TYPE - the options will change when you select ‘YES’ Select either ‘Standard Remote ID’ or ‘Remote ID Broadcast Module’ Enter in the Remote ID Serial Number If your drone has Remote ID built-in (ie, Standard Remote ID), use your drone’s serial number. If you are adding a Remote ID Broadcast Module, use the Remote ID Broadcast Module’s serial number. Figure 5: Update your Serial Number Reading Remote Identification One of the primary goals of Remote Identification is to provide information for law enforcement and other security personnel to assist in identifying aerial threats. Remote ID messages are relayed in two mechanisms with two versions: Bluetooth 4 Legacy Advertising Bluetooth 5 Long Range Advertising WiFi Neighbor Awareness Network (NAN) WiFi Beacon The mechanism in which the Remote ID message is relayed is significant to whether they may be detected. Mobile Devices The intent behind Remote ID is to enable mobile devices to detect and receive messages in the field. However, this aspect of Remote ID is underdeveloped at this point. Android devices can receive RID messages over Bluetooth and Wi-Fi iOS devices can only receive RID messages over Bluetooth Available Apps There are two apps available for reading Remote ID messages OpenDroneID - Available on Android DroneScanner - Available on Android and iOS Turn off Wi-Fi scan throttling By default, Android versions 8.0 and above prohibit frequent scans of Wi-Fi networks. To enable high-frequency scans necessary for Remote ID, you must disable Wi-Fi scan throttling. Turn On Developer Mode Go to “Settings” Tap “About Device” or “About Phone” Tap “Software Information” Tap “Build number” seven (7) times. Enter your pattern, PIN or password to enable the Developer options menu “Developer Options” menu will now appear in your Settings Menu Enter Developer Options Scroll Down to the Network category Turn Off Wi-Fi scan throttling Drone Broadcasting Not all drones broadcast Remote ID in the same way. The following table depicts the mechanism for common drone manufactures use for Remote ID. Bluetooth Wi-Fi DJI Series - X Autel Series X - Skydio - X Cube ID (ArduPilot) X - BlueMark db120 X X Dronetag Beacon X X iOS devices are currently only able to read RemoteID messages over Bluetooth. Frequently Asked Questions Can I move my Broadcast Module between drones? It is not recommended as of right now. In order to move broadcast modules between drones, you also need to update both drone’s serial number and remote ID serial number in their FAA registration to document the change. While it is currently free to do until December 2023, afterwords it will be the equivalent of registering a new drone ($5). I don’t like Remote Identification. Do I have to comply? Will the UC do anything to me? Yes, it is required by law that all airborne drones need to be equipped with RID by September 16, 2023. If not, you may only fly your drone in a FRIA. Failure to comply with Federal Regulations is a violation of University Policy and may be subject to disciplinary actions. Can I turn off RID while flying in a FRIA? No. If your drone has the ability to broadcast RID, it must be on at all times while the drone is in flight. Where can I buy a Broadcast RemoteID module? We recommend: BlueMark db120, ~$140 or Dronetag Beacon, ~$220. Network RemoteID is not required in the US. Is it better to get a new drone with Standard Remote ID or get a Broadcast Remote ID module? At this point, there is no major difference. After BVLOS regulations are published (TBD, est. 2025), only Standard RemoteID drones will be eligible for BVLOS operations. See our table of regulations for additional information. After I buy a Broadcast Remote ID module, is there anything I need to do? Once you receive it and install it on your drone (velcro works well), edit your drone’s FAA registration. See above for instructions. Typically, no further configuration is necessary within the US. If you plan on taking this drone internationally, additional configuration may be necessary.

While these bills ensure funding to the FAA, they’re also used to make significant regulatory changes. The FAA Reauthorization Bill of 2012 introduced Section 333 exemptions and the pathway forward for Part 107. The FAA Reauthorization Bill of 2018 revamped regulations around the recreational use of drones and introduced academic and educational exemptions. The first draft of the 2023 Reauthorization Bill was released on 6/9/2023 and looks like it takes a couple of steps forward, but also a couple of steps back for the UC’s drone activity. A couple of quick notes on the current draft (6/9/2023): Adds elementary and secondary schools to the academic/educational exemption list. Requires a BVLOS NPRM to be published within four months and the final rule within 16 months. Requires the FAA to put together a UTM CONOPS within one year Explore the feasibility of Network-based RemoteID Waiver evaluation can explore using AI to improve response time; waiver evaluators may now consider property access and ownership during the evaluation process. Launches an FAA Aviation Infrastructure Inspection Pilot Program - bans all Chinese drones from participating Launches a critical infrastructure inspection grant program for governmental entities - bans all Chinese drones from participating Continues the FAA Workforce development grant program - bans all Chinese drones from participating Mix-bag so far. Some reasonable steps to push the drone industry. Disappointing to see the proposal to prohibit using Chinese drones within the workforce development grant program. Low-cost drones are often made in China, making excellent training drones, especially in K-12 programs. DJI drones are still the dominant drones used in industry, so banning their participation in workforce development limits how much workforce development can occur if the participants can’t use the industry standards. CA AB1016 Pest control operations: aircraft operations: private applicator Passed CA Assembly, working through CA Senate: Link to Bill Utilizing a drone for pest control operations in CA has several hurdles. In addition to the FAA regulations (Obtaining a DOT waiver for over 55 lbs and Part 137 Certificates), to spray pesticides in California, you need to have either an Aerial Applicator license or an Unmanned Aerial Applicator License as a journeyman, apprentice, or vector control technician. Even obtaining an unmanned license takes a considerable amount of effort. Getting the entry-level journeyman’s certificate requires you to apprentice for at least one year and with 150 hours of flight experience. AB1016 proposes to create a new status of the Unmanned license as a private applicator, similar to the existing law for non-aerial applications. Private applicators can only apply pesticides on property owned, leased, or rented by the certificate holder or their employer. Under this proposal, a person may obtain a regular private applicator license through existing processes, then after completion of additional training developed by DPR, could apply for the new unmanned aerial license with status as a private applicator. If passed, this would be a significant advancement for the University of California - UC ANR has considerable training available for the Private Applicator Certification Exam, and with a bit of training, would be able to stand up a fleet of aerial applicators. As this bill progresses, we’ll update this page with further information. The Recreational UAS Safety Test (TRUST) Starting in June 2021, all recreational flyers must pass an aeronautical knowledge and safety test and provide proof of test passage (the TRUST completion certificate) to the FAA or law enforcement (including campus police) upon request. The test is free for everyone and takes 20-30 minutes. You may take The Recreational UAS Safety Test at any of the administrators found on the FAA’s website: https://www.faa.gov/uas/recreational_fliers/knowledge_test_updates/ The TRUST is divided into two sections: The first section provides the information needed to pass the test. The second section is a series of multiple-choice questions. You cannot fail the test. If you answer a question incorrectly, you will be provided with information on why the answer you chose was incorrect and will be promoted to try again. Upon completion of the TRUST, you will receive a completion certificate. The certificate never expires; however, if you lose your certificate, you will need to retake the test and obtain a new certificate. Neither the test administrator nor the FAA will maintain personally identifiable information about the recreational flyer, so it is impossible to re-print or re-issue your original certificate. We recommend uploading your certificate to UC Drones so that you have a backup copy available. NASA Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) The NASA Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) is a voluntary, confidential, non-punitive safety reporting system that receives safety reports from pilots, air traffic controllers, dispatchers, cabin crew, maintenance technicians, and now UAS operators. Anyone involved in UAS operations can file a NASA ASRS report to describe close calls, hazards, violations, and safety-related incidents. ASRS has been an essential part of the aviation safety culture for over 45 years, collecting and analyzing over 1.7 million safety reports. All reports are held in strict confidence by NASA and de-identified by ASRS Safety Analysts. The resulting anonymous aviation safety data and lessons learned are shared with the aviation and UAS communities to prevent accidents and help make UAS operations safer. When in doubt, fill it out! https://asrs.arc.nasa.gov/report/caveat.html?formType=uas Regulations Update 2021 Quick Answers On December 27, 2020, the DOT and the FAA released the final version of two highly anticipated regulations. The new rules will require Remote Identification (Remote ID) of drones and allow operators of small drones to fly over people and at night under certain conditions. The FAA press release has links to the final rules and executive summaries. We’ll be updating this page with Frequently Asked Questions. What is the new Remote Pilot Certificate Renewal Program? Starting April 6, 2021, the new free and online Remote Pilot Certificate Program will be available through the FAA Safety Team (FAASTeam) website here: https://www.faasafety.gov/default.aspx. It will replace the certificate renewal test (Unmanned General - Recurrent: UGR). This new renewal program will take about 2 hours to complete and include a multiple-choice exam. Completing this renewal program will allow RPICs to take advantage of the regulatory changes enabling flight operations at night and over people with qualified drones. Will this stop my current flight operations? Absolutely not. Any current operation may continue as previously approved. The new regulations will not impose any new restrictions until September 2023. Further guidance will be provided as we get closer. Do I need to buy something to be compliant? Honestly, probably not. Many drones are a firmware update away from compliance, and mandatory compliance will not be until Summer 2023. For those drones that cannot be made Remote ID compliant via firmware update, expect to see Remote ID retrofit kits on the market within the next year or so. Should I buy a Remote ID-compliant drone? Remote ID compliant drones are readily available now. The full list can be found here. Is there a difference between a Standard Remote ID drone and one that is retrofitted? Yes, but the difference will likely be insignificant for most users. Retrofitted drones will be prohibited from Beyond Visual Line of Sight flight operations. While many researchers hope to expand to BVLOS flight operations, FAA waivers will continue to be challenging for a handful more years. If you want to expand to BVLOS flight operations, consider waiting until Standard Remote ID drones are on the market. When can I start flying over people? Flight authorizations for drones in Category 1 (Under 250 grams with rotor protections) will be allowed as soon as the Final Rule is enacted (March). Flight authorizations in Category 2 and 3 require an FAA certificate to be issued to the manufacturer, which may take additional time. As of 2023, only one model has received Category 2 or 3 authorization. The full list can be found here The Categories of Drones The revision of Part 107 regulations and the introduction of Remote ID regulations have created 15 Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems categories.
