["ch-FAQs.html", "Frequently Asked Questions", " Frequently Asked Questions What is the UC Policy on drones? The University of California recognizes that UAS offer great potential as tools for research and other educational functions as well as providing opportunities for recreational use and business pursuits across a diverse array of users and industries. The University also has an obligation to consider public safety, privacy, civil rights and civil liberties issues related to the use of UAS. In short, all UAS usage on UC property, for UC business or by UC-owned UAS must be pre-approved and documented by the designated UAS campus point of contact. In addition, non-UC operators on UC property must maintain sufficient liability insurance coverage. Who do I contact to fly on my campus? A list of the campus points of contact can be found here. Please understand that in many cases, the use of UAS on UC property are regulated by existing campus policies on activities, registered organizations and use of properties. These regulations are designed to protect and promote the rights of the members of the University, prevent interference with University functions or activities and assure compliance with all pertinent laws and other applicable University policies. For UC students, staff and faculty, you may submit a Flight Request with UC Drones Web App or contact the campus for additional or alternative means to submit a request. I need to fly a drone for my research. What do I need to do? How long does it take for approval? There may be several special circumstances, but in general, the operator must have an sUAS license from the FAA and must submit a Flight Request to the local campus point of contact. Depending on the complexity and timing of the request, the flight request could be approved in minutes or may take several weeks if extra FAA approval or coordination is necessary. A Flight Request may be a single flight, a set of flights or cover a year’s worth of activity – the details can be coordinated during the request. What are the laws for flying a drone in the US? The most common applicable set of laws for flying a drone is Part 107 (Flying for Work or Business https://www.faa.gov/uas/commercial_operators/). This set of law requires the operator to have an SUAS license, have a registered drone and follow the drone laws that limit drone flying to up to 400 ft AGL, during daylight only and may not fly over people or moving vehicles. There are additionally special circumstances or restrictions for foreign nationals (international students, visiting scholars), operating on certain public lands, or within certain states or municipalities. Can I fly a personal drone for my research project or my department? Yes, as long as you comply with UC policy. Anyone operating under UC policy for university business (regardless of ownership) may additionally be provided with UC UAS liability insurance coverage free of charge. I have a complicated or non-standard scenario. Who should I contact to identify what I need to do? Please feel free to contact either your campus point of contact or the UC Center of Excellence on UAS Safety. We will work to ensure that there is a path forward for you to conduct your flight activity. We have experience with international UAS regulations, public agency airworthiness certification, night-time operations, airspace authorizations, DOT foreign national operator permits and agricultural spraying certificates to name a few.

["ch-cybersecurity.html", "Cybersecurity Concerns Cybersecurity Risk Mitigation Strategies", " Cybersecurity Concerns The use of an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) designed, manufactured, or supplied by foreign companies could create increased cybersecurity risks and opportunities for network exploitation and collection by foreign threat actors. Cybersecurity Risk Potential security risks can arise when UAS manufacturers require users to register online and agree to store sensitive data on overseas or even domestic computer servers. These servers are typically maintained by the manufacturers, but can be accessed by third-party application vendors. In addition, online services offered by UAS manufacturers could create opportunities for the theft or seizure of sensitive information and the monitoring of user activities. Foreign threat actors could exploit: Flight log data, including information about network layouts and the locations of inspections and critical assets; Organizations’ computer network data and systems; Images or recordings captured during flights, including physical security assets, vulnerabilities, and transportation networks; Corporate proprietary information or intellectual property; LE-sensitive information; Sensor data collected during critical infrastructure inspections; Emergency response operations and mission-planning information; Sensitive facility locations and assets; and Customers’ personally identifiable information (PII). Mitigation Strategies Here are a couple of suggestions to reduce the potential data risks and vulnerabilities associated with UAS use and mitigate the loss of sensitive information. During initial UAS activation, use a department or lab name, email address, and password to reduce a UAS manufacturer’s ability to track the owner/user through association with this identifier. Note: It should be assumed that the current GPS location will be transmitted during UAS activation, which could reveal the true owner. Use a new mobile device without a SIM card installed or set up previously and never used for other activities for that will contain limited to no PII collectable by a foreign UAS company. For previously used devices, performing a wipe and factory reset of the mobile device prior to using it as a controller is advisable. Periodically wipe or clear sensitive data from the system, including information stored on onboard or removable digital storage devices—such as SD and memory cards—and on connected flight controllers and mobile devices. Sensitive data should also be cleared before returning borrowed or rented UASs. Avoid connecting the UAS to internal or private networks with sensitive data. Use a known secured network to register the UAS, and use a local backup device to store footage and data. Before applying UAS patches and upgrades, consider their impact on operations. Review user agreements to verify who has access to data collected by the UAS. Inquire or review user agreements for information about third-party access to UAS data. Maintain awareness of third-party collection and retention of data collected during UAS operations and develop appropriate policies to ensure the protection of intellectual property and sensitive operations.
