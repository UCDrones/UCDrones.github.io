["ch-FAQs.html", "Frequently Asked Questions", " Frequently Asked Questions What is the UC Policy on drones? The University of California recognizes that UAS offer great potential as tools for research and other educational functions as well as providing opportunities for recreational use and business pursuits across a diverse array of users and industries. The University also has an obligation to consider public safety, privacy, civil rights and civil liberties issues related to the use of UAS. In short, all UAS usage on UC property, for UC business or by UC-owned UAS must be pre-approved and documented by the designated UAS campus point of contact. In addition, non-UC operators on UC property must maintain sufficient liability insurance coverage. Who do I contact to fly on my campus? A list of the campus points of contact can be found here. Please understand that in many cases, the use of UAS on UC property are regulated by existing campus policies on activities, registered organizations and use of properties. These regulations are designed to protect and promote the rights of the members of the University, prevent interference with University functions or activities and assure compliance with all pertinent laws and other applicable University policies. For UC students, staff and faculty, you may submit a Flight Request with UC Drones Web App or contact the campus for additional or alternative means to submit a request. I need to fly a drone for my research. What do I need to do? How long does it take for approval? There may be several special circumstances, but in general, the operator must have an sUAS license from the FAA and must submit a Flight Request to the local campus point of contact. Depending on the complexity and timing of the request, the flight request could be approved in minutes or may take several weeks if extra FAA approval or coordination is necessary. A Flight Request may be a single flight, a set of flights or cover a year’s worth of activity – the details can be coordinated during the request. What are the laws for flying a drone in the US? The most common applicable set of laws for flying a drone is Part 107 (Flying for Work or Business https://www.faa.gov/uas/commercial_operators/). This set of law requires the operator to have an SUAS license, have a registered drone and follow the drone laws that limit drone flying to up to 400 ft AGL, during daylight only and may not fly over people or moving vehicles. There are additionally special circumstances or restrictions for foreign nationals (international students, visiting scholars), operating on certain public lands, or within certain states or municipalities. Can I fly a personal drone for my research project or my department? Yes, as long as you comply with UC policy. Anyone operating under UC policy for university business (regardless of ownership) may additionally be provided with UC UAS liability insurance coverage free of charge. I have a complicated or non-standard scenario. Who should I contact to identify what I need to do? Please feel free to contact either your campus point of contact or the UC Center of Excellence on UAS Safety. We will work to ensure that there is a path forward for you to conduct your flight activity. We have experience with international UAS regulations, public agency airworthiness certification, night-time operations, airspace authorizations, DOT foreign national operator permits and agricultural spraying certificates to name a few. I’m looking to fly a drone, but it says we are within 5 miles from the Davis Airport (KEDU). Is there anything we need to do to get approval to fly? The Davis Airport (KEDU) is an airport in Class G airspace, and no Airspace Authorization is required. Additionally, the requirement to notify all airports within 5 miles has been rescinded. You may fly a drone wherever you have permission to do so, without being required to notify KEDU. "],

["ch-cybersecurity.html", "Cybersecurity Concerns Cybersecurity Risk Mitigation Strategies", " Cybersecurity Concerns The use of an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) designed, manufactured, or supplied by foreign companies could create increased cybersecurity risks and opportunities for network exploitation and collection by foreign threat actors. Cybersecurity Risk Potential security risks can arise when UAS manufacturers require users to register online and agree to store sensitive data on overseas or even domestic computer servers. These servers are typically maintained by the manufacturers, but can be accessed by third-party application vendors. In addition, online services offered by UAS manufacturers could create opportunities for the theft or seizure of sensitive information and the monitoring of user activities. Foreign threat actors could exploit: Flight log data, including information about network layouts and the locations of inspections and critical assets; Organizations’ computer network data and systems; Images or recordings captured during flights, including physical security assets, vulnerabilities, and transportation networks; Corporate proprietary information or intellectual property; LE-sensitive information; Sensor data collected during critical infrastructure inspections; Emergency response operations and mission-planning information; Sensitive facility locations and assets; and Customers’ personally identifiable information (PII). Mitigation Strategies Here are a couple of suggestions to reduce the potential data risks and vulnerabilities associated with UAS use and mitigate the loss of sensitive information. During initial UAS activation, use a department or lab name, email address, and password to reduce a UAS manufacturer’s ability to track the owner/user through association with this identifier. Note: It should be assumed that the current GPS location will be transmitted during UAS activation, which could reveal the true owner. Use a new mobile device without a SIM card installed or set up previously and never used for other activities for that will contain limited to no PII collectable by a foreign UAS company. For previously used devices, performing a wipe and factory reset of the mobile device prior to using it as a controller is advisable. Periodically wipe or clear sensitive data from the system, including information stored on onboard or removable digital storage devices—such as SD and memory cards—and on connected flight controllers and mobile devices. Sensitive data should also be cleared before returning borrowed or rented UASs. Avoid connecting the UAS to internal or private networks with sensitive data. Use a known secured network to register the UAS, and use a local backup device to store footage and data. Before applying UAS patches and upgrades, consider their impact on operations. Review user agreements to verify who has access to data collected by the UAS. Inquire or review user agreements for information about third-party access to UAS data. Maintain awareness of third-party collection and retention of data collected during UAS operations and develop appropriate policies to ensure the protection of intellectual property and sensitive operations.

["regulations-update.html", "Regulations Update Quick Answers The Categories of Drones", " Regulations Update On December 27, 2020, the DOT and the FAA released the final version of two highly anticipating regulations. The new rules will require Remote Identification (Remote ID) of drones and allow operators of small drones to fly over people and at night under certain conditions. The FAA press release has links to the final rules and executive summaries. We’ll be updating this page with Frequently Asked Questions Quick Answers What is the new Remote Pilot Certificate Renewal Program? Starting April 6, 2021, the new free and online Remote Pilot Certificate Program will be available through the FAA Safety Team (FAASTeam) website here: https://www.faasafety.gov/default.aspx. It will replace the certificate renewal test (Unmanned General - Recurrent: UGR) test. This new renewal program will take about 2 hours to complete and will include a multiple choice exam. Completing this renewal program will allow RPICs to take advantage of the regulatory changes enabling flight operations at night and over people with qualified drones. Will this stop my current flight operations? Absolutely not. Any current operation may continue as previously approved. The new regulations will not impose any new restrictions until Summer 2023. Further guidance will be provided as we get closer. Do I need to buy something to be compliant? Honestly, probably not. Many drones are a firmware update away from compliance and mandatory compliance will not be until Summer 2023. For those drones that cannot be made Remote ID compliant via firmware update, expect to see Remote ID retrofit kits on the market within the next year or so. Should I wait to buy a Remote ID compliant drone? If you need to purchase a drone for immediate use, you should. But expect to see Remote ID compliant drones on the market by Summer 2022 if you think you can wait that long. Is there a difference between a Standard Remote ID drone and one that is retrofitted? Yes, but the difference will not likely to be significant for most users in the near-term. Retrofitted drones will be prohibited from Beyond Visual Line of Sight flight operations. While many researchers are hoping to expand to BVLOS flight operations, FAA waivers will continue to be difficult to obtain for a handful more years. If you are hoping to expand to BVLOS flight operations, you should consider waiting until Standard Remote ID drones are on the market. When can I start flying over people? Flight authorizations for drones in Category 1 (Under 250 grams with rotor protections) will be allowed as soon as the Final Rule is enacted (March). Flight authorizations in Category 2 and 3 require an FAA certificate to be issued to the manufacturer which may take some additional time. However, there are a handful of models that are expected to receive a certificate shortly. The Mavic Mini 2 is not eligible for Category 1 - with the attached required rotor protections, the final weight exceeds the 250 g threshold. However, the Mavic Mini 2 is likely to obtain Category 2 approval quickly. The Mavic 2 Series are likely to be eligible for Category 2 with an ASTM certified parachute system When can I start flying at night? You can start flying at night under the UC night flying waiver, or otherwise, you must wait until you take the upcoming FAA UAS training for certificate renewal. The new training has not yet been published, but is anticipated within the next month or two. The Categories of Drones The revision of Part 107 regulations and the introduction of RemoteID regulations have created 15 categories of Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems. Standard Remote ID Broadcast/Retrofit Remote ID No Remote ID Cat 0 - Not Eligible for Flights Over People No flights over people. BVLOS (with waiver) No flights over people. VLOS only No flights over people. VLOS only. FRIA only (2023) Cat 1 - &lt; 250 g + rotor protections Flights over open air assemblies of people.
