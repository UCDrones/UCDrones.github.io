<p>DJI drones have been in the news recently, sometimes with alarmist headlines such as ‘DJI BLACKLISTED.’ On this page, we will clear up some misconceptions.</p>
<p>DJI (Dà-Jiāng Innovations Science and Technology Co., Ltd) is a Chinese technology company that manufactures drones and camera stabilization systems.</p>
<p>Concerns regarding DJI drones typically stem from the following items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cybersecurity concerns with DJI - unsecured data links between GCS and drone</li>
<li>Cybersecurity concerns with DJI - Apps collect unauthorized information from devices</li>
<li>Cybersecurity concerns with data transfer to DJI servers, which may include images, video, and telemetry data.</li>
<li>China’s National Intelligence Law requires Chinese companies to cooperate with the government.</li>
<li>DJI’s role in the Chinese government’s Military-Civil Fusion strategy</li>
<li>DJI’s alleged involvement in the surveillance of ethnic minority Uighurs in China’s far-western region of Xinjiang.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>These concerns have varying levels of validity and impact, and the news headlines can often be misleading.</strong></p>
<div id="frequently-asked-questions" class="section level2 hasAnchor">
<h2>Frequently Asked Questions<a href="dji-drones.html#frequently-asked-questions" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Are DJI Drones’ blacklisted’?</strong></p>
<p>As of today, DJI Drones have the following restrictions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Department of Defense prohibits its funds from being used to purchase or use any commercial off-the-shelf drones, regardless of manufacturer, due to cybersecurity concerns. <a href="https://dronedj.com/2018/06/07/department-of-defense-bans-the-purchase-of-commercial-over-the-shelf-uas-including-dji-drones/">Announcement</a></li>
<li>The Department of Defense prohibits the use of all commercial off-the-shelf drones from being used on military facilities and property. <a href="https://dronedj.com/2018/06/07/department-of-defense-bans-the-purchase-of-commercial-over-the-shelf-uas-including-dji-drones/">Announcement</a></li>
<li>The Department of the Interior prohibits any funds (including from grants/contracts) from purchasing foreign-made drones without authorization. However, the existing fleet of DJI drones used by the Department of the Interior is still allowed. <a href="https://uas.nifc.gov/sites/default/files/sites/default/files/inline-files/UASP_20221021_OAS-28%20Information%20Bulletin.pdf">Announcement</a></li>
<li>The Department of Justice prohibits the purchase or use of any drone that is manufactured or assembled by a covered foreign entity, which includes DJI <a href="https://www.ojp.gov/sites/g/files/xyckuh241/files/media/document/ojporderfundingdrones.pdf">(Announcement)</a>.</li>
<li>As of January 2023, Florida prohibits all state agencies from purchasing or using any drone, not from an approved manufacturer. The list of Florida Approved Manufacturers can be found <a href="https://www.dms.myflorida.com/business_operations/state_purchasing/approved_drone_manufacturers">here</a>. DJI is not an approved manufacturer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite the headlines, actual DJI drone restrictions are uncommon. However, if you do not want to use a drone from DJI for any reason, feel free to purchase an alternative.</p>
<p>If you have documentation of another agency or entity that prohibits or restricts DJI drones, please let me know so I can update this list.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>I heard a law called “PROHIBITION ON OPERATION OR PROCUREMENT OF FOREIGN-MADE UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS” applies to all federal funds. Is this true?“</strong></p>
<p>No. There is a law by that name; however, it does not apply to all federal funds. This law can be found in Section 848 of the <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/PLAW-116publ92/html/PLAW-116publ92.htm">NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2020</a>. However, the section’s title is misleading - this law only applies to the Department of Defense. From the actual text of the law - “The Secretary of Defense may not operate or enter into or renew a contract for the procurement of – (a) a covered unmanned aircraft system…”</p></li>
<li><p><strong>I heard from my grant point of contact that DJI drones are prohibited. Are they wrong?</strong></p>
<p>Without further information, it is unclear. That person may be mistaken or are aware of a more direct policy that affects their particular division or group. If you are instructed by your research grant point of contact not to use DJI drones or that DJI drones are prohibited from being purchased, please abide by those instructions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Did the government ban people from buying DJI drones?</strong></p>
<p>No. While individual agencies and departments implement some restrictions, there are no nationwide bans from purchasing or using DJI drones. In addition, the government did not ban the import of DJI drones for sale.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Has the UC system banned DJI drones?</strong></p>
<p>No. There are currently no UC systemwide restrictions on purchasing or using DJI drones. Additionally, as of today, no UC campus has restrictions on purchasing or using DJI drones.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Are there cybersecurity concerns with DJI drones?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. All smart technology should be considered to have cybersecurity concerns, including drones. The primary concern of DJI drones is whether they can send data back to the Chinese government. DJI drones can upload data, including images, videos, and telemetry data, back to DJI data servers (the cloud) for storage. There is concern that this data may be accessible by the Chinese government and that the data may also include security concerns such as wifi network configurations that may be used for breaching networks. There have been numerous reports that both <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/2706082/department-statement-on-dji-systems/">support</a> and <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/501740-no-evidence-of-unauthorized-data-transfers-by-top-chinese-drone/">refute</a> these concerns.</p>
<p>There are several effective ways to mitigate these cybersecurity concerns with proper cybersecurity practices.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not use your own personal devices (phones, tablets) or personal accounts (social media) when working with University equipment. Instead, register the drones to lab or department email accounts.</li>
<li>Purchase platforms that do not require an additional phone or tablet. The higher-quality DJI projects, including the Enterprise editions and the Matrice series, offer all-in-one controllers that provide all of the necessary capabilities while not requiring an additional device.</li>
<li>If a phone or tablet is required for operation, purchase a separate device without a SIM card.</li>
<li>Do not authorize DJI to connect to any of your personal social media accounts</li>
<li>Disable participation in DJI’s image and video social sharing service SkyPixel</li>
<li>Only connect the drone to wireless networks appropriate for the general public, with security measures in place.</li>
</ul>
<p>For further information, we have posted guidance on addressing <a href="https://ucdrones.github.io/ch-cybersecurity.html">cybersecurity concerns</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>If I don’t want to get a DJI drone, what should I get?</strong></p>
<p>If you would like to explore non-DJI drones, we have put together a list of drones on this page and have included information on the manufacturer, where the drone is manufactured, whether it is Remote ID compliant, whether it is NDAA 848 compliant and whether it is on the BlueSUAS list.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Is DJI funded by the Chinese government?</strong></p>
<p>According to DJI spokesman Adam Lisbern, “DJI is privately held. The company is solely managed by and majority-owned by the founder team. Shareholders other than founders do not participate in the company’s management and operation.” <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/02/01/china-funding-drones-dji-us-regulators/">Washington Post</a>. DJI maintains that it had not received direct investments from the Chinese government. However, it has been reported that divisions of China’s State Council directly administer some funds that list DJI as an investment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Can I collaborate with DJI on Drone research?</strong></p>
<p>Most likely, no. As with all collaborations with foreign entities, please consult your export control office for an authorized review. In Dec 2020, DJI was placed on an economic sanction list that restricts the export of US patents and intellectual properties to DJI, citing involvement in wide-scale human rights abuses within China through high-technology surveillance and/or facilitated the export of items by China that aid repressive regimes around the world, contrary to US foreign policy interests.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>What is NDAA 848 Compliance?</strong></p>
<p>While Section 848 of the <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/PLAW-116publ92/html/PLAW-116publ92.htm">NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2020</a> applies only to the Department of Defense, other agencies have begun to use this as a basis for determining ‘safe’ drones. NDAA 848 compliance specifically means that</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The drone is not manufactured in China or manufactured by a Chinese company; and</li>
<li>The drone does not contain any major components made in China or by a Chinese company. Major components are defined as:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Flight controllers</li>
<li>Radios</li>
<li>Data transmission devices</li>
<li>Cameras</li>
<li>Gimbals</li>
</ol></li>
<li>The drone does not use a ground control system or operating software developed in China or by a Chinese company; and</li>
<li>The drone does not use network connectivity or data storage located in China or administered by a Chinese company.</li>
</ol></li>

## Alternatives to DJI

If you would like to explore non-DJI drones, there is a list of drones approved by the Department of Defense for acceptable use at most Department of Defense locations: https://www.diu.mil/blue-uas-cleared-list. This list focuses on drones used for surveillance operations; however, it includes options such as Skydio and AgEagle eBee drones that may be useful to UC researchers. 

-The Blue SUAS list drones are not generally available to the public; however, public versions are available. However, a recent Department of the Interior report pointed out that the drones on the Blue SUAS list were [8-14 times more expensive and only 20% as capable as the currently available DJI drones](https://dronedj.com/2021/07/19/interior-department-slams-blue-suas-drones/).

<!-- ## In The News -->
<!-- ### Department of the Navy Memo - May 24, 2017 -->
<!-- [Memo](https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/sites/default/files/documents/6574684/National-Security-Archive-Department-of-the-Navy.pdf) -->
<!-- **Background** -->
<!-- The Department of the Navy issued an internal memo on May 24, 2017. Though the content of the report would not be publically revealed until 2019 following a FOIA request, this memo is cited by other Department of Defense units in support of banning DJI drones. This memo states lists the following Operational Risks for utilizing DJI drones: -->
<!-- 1. Cybersecurity Risks -->
<!-- 2. Electromagnetic Compatibility -->
<!-- 3. The Need for Training and Technical Support -->
<!-- 4. Low Reliability -->
<!-- Though this memo lists cybersecurity issues related to DJI drones, it does not ban the use of DJI drones. Instead, it offers the following recommended mitigations. -->
<!-- 1. Conduct training operations in areas that limit the potential of adversaries to be in reception range of the GCS and Air Vehicle signals. -->
<!-- 2. Conduct training in areas that are not operationally sensitive. -->
<!-- 3. Do not connect the GCS to military networks using wired or wireless connections. -->
<!-- 4. Avoid connecting the GCS to the world wide web using wired or wireless connections, but if necessary, ensure all images, video and flight records are deleted from the GCS cache and micro-SD cards prior to connection to the web. -->
<!-- 5. The Air Vehicle has the capability to store images/video on a micro-SD card when installed in the GCS, the air vehicle, or a combination of both. Due to the potential for loss of the air vehicle, operation with the SD card installed is NOT RECOMMENDED. The DJI platforms can perform all necessary flight functions without the use of recording media. This means both GCS internal memory (cache), and external memory. -->
<!-- 6. Cover the camera when not in use using the plastic gimbal support included in the kit. -->
<!-- 7. Do not use Personal Phones (i.e. 3G/4G/LTE Network) or Hot spots to access Map Data. -->
<!-- The memo states that there are two major concerns: 1) The data link between the GCS and the drone may be passively viewed or intercepted, and 2) when any part of the system is connected to the web, images, video and flight records could be uploaded to unsecure servers. This memo provides no evidence or cites substantiated reports. The memo states that "A thorough study of the cyber vulnerabilities of these systems is not available at this time." -->
<!-- **Impact** -->
<!-- Despite not banning DJI drones, this memo was cited in later reports to support the banning of DJI drones.  -->
<!-- ### Department of the Army Memo - August 2, 2017 -->
<!-- [News Report](https://dronelife.com/2017/08/05/dji-us-army-cyber-vulnerabilities/) -->
<!-- **Background** -->
<!-- **Impact** -->
<!-- **Summary** -->
<!-- The Department of the Army followed actions by the Navy, and based on the recommendations from the Army Research Laboratory, ordered all personnel to cease all use, uninstall all DJI applications, remove all batteries/storage media from DJI drones. -->
<!-- ### Department of Defense Unclassified/For Official Use Only Memo - May 23, 2018 -->
<!-- [News Report](https://dronedj.com/2018/06/07/department-of-defense-bans-the-purchase-of-commercial-over-the-shelf-uas-including-dji-drones/) -->
<!-- **Background** -->
<!-- **Impact** -->
<!-- **Summary** -->
<!-- This internal memo, sent to the officials within the Department of Defense, effectively suspended the purchase of all commercial off-the-shelf drones as well as the use of these drones until the DoD develops a strategy to adequately assess and mitigate the risks associated with their use. -->
<!-- ### National Defense Authorization Act of 2020 - December 9, 2019 -->
<!-- [Bill](https://www.congress.gov/116/crpt/hrpt333/CRPT-116hrpt333.pdf) -->
<!-- **Summary** -->
<!-- The National Defense Authorization Act of 2020 included new legislation in Section 848 that bars DoD employees from procuring drone components such as flight controllers, developed or manufactuered in a covered foreign country, specifically China. -->
<!-- The provision prohibits the Department of Defense from using or renewing a contract for an UAS that: -->
<!-- was manufactured in -->
<!-- uses equipment, like cameras or flight controllers, manufactured in -->
<!-- employs a ground control system developed in or -->
<!-- utilizes a network or data storage administered by China or an entity domiciled in China. -->
<!-- **Impact** -->
<!-- This legislation codifies existing bans by the Department of Defense. By this point, the Department of Defense had already implemented complete bans on all commercial off-the-shelf drones, exceeding the restrictions created by this legislation. -->
<!-- ### OJP Order 2700.1 - October 5, 2020 -->
<!-- **Background** -->
<!-- **Impact** -->
<!-- **Summary** -->
<!-- The Department of Justice announcement on October 5, 2020 restricts Department of Justice funds awarded or made available through a contract, grant, or cooperative agreement from being used to purchase DJI drones, and additionally prohibits the use of DJI drones within the scope of work of those agreements. -->
<!-- ### DoC RIN 0694-AI37 - Dec 22, 2020 -->
<!-- **Background** -->
<!-- **Impact** -->
<!-- **Summary** -->
<!-- The US Department of Commerce added DJI to the 'Entity List.' The Entity List identifies entities for which there is reasonable cause to believe that the entities are involved in activities contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States. Export Control regulations will now require license requirements for exports of technology to DJI. -->
<!-- ### DoD Department Statement on DJI Systems - July 23, 2021 -->
<!-- [Announcement](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/2706082/department-statement-on-dji-systems/) -->
<!-- **Background** -->
<!-- On July 23, 2021 the Department of Defense issued a statement clarifying its position on DJI drones. They state unequivocoly, that DJI poses a potential threat to national security. This statement however is a refutement of a 'leaked' report that suggested that the Department of Defense had reviewed or approved of DJI drones for purchase by other US governmental departments or agencies. -->
<!-- **Impact** -->
<!-- **Summary** -->
<!-- ### DoD Section 1260H - Oct 5, 2022 -->
<!-- **Background** -->
<!-- On October 5, 2022, the US Department of Defense issued an announcement that DJI was identified as a company operating directly or indirectly within the United States and identified as a Military-Civil Fusion Contributor. This announcement was made under a new reporting requirement passed in the National Defense Authorization Act of 2021. As defined in law, entities that must be identified fit under the below categories: -->
<!-- 1. Entities knowingly receiving assistance from the Government of China or the Chinese Communist Party through science and technology efforts initiated under the Chinese military industrial planning apparatus; -->
<!-- 2. Entities affiliated with the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, including research partnerships and projects;  -->
<!-- 3. Entities receiving assistance, operational direction or policy guidance from the State Administration for Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense;  -->
<!-- 4. Any entities or subsidiaries defined as a "defense enterprise" by the State Council of the People's Republic of China;  -->
<!-- 5. Entities residing in or affiliated with a military-civil fusion enterprise zone or receiving assistance from the Government of China through such enterprise zone. -->
<!-- 6. Entities awarded with receipt of military production licenses by the Government of China;  -->
<!-- 7. Entities that advertise on national, provincial, and non-governmental military equipment procurement platforms in the People's Republic of China; or  -->
<!-- 8. Any other entities the Secretary determines is appropriate. -->
<!-- The identification of companies that may be related to military complexes is not a new development. Section 1260H is similar, but distinct from an earlier reporting requirement under Section 1237 of the 1999 National Defense Authorization Act. The Section 1237 reporting requirement in its current form after modification in 2005, requires identification of entities affiliated with any minitry of the People's Republic of China, particularly targeting 'Communist China Military Companies.' As of today, DJI has not been identifed under Section 1237. -->
<!-- **Impact** -->
<!-- However, by itself, the announcement under Section 1260H is just an announcement of identification. Further regulatory or executive action is required to take action against companies identified under Section 1260H.   -->
<!-- **Summary** -->
<!-- The Department of Defense announcement on October 5, 2022 is an announcement of identification. As of today, no further action has been taken to penalize identified companies. -->
